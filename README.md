A simple Nike website built using React, Tailwind and Vite in the process of learning Tailwind CSS through [@adrianhajdin](https://github.com/adrianhajdin).

Additional to basic app, I have added dark and light mode funtionality through my own exploration and planning to add more features very soon.
